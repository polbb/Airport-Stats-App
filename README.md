# Project Description:
## __Tittle:__ Airport Data Management and Visualization
This repository contains a comprehensive GUI-based application tailored for the management and visualization of airport data. The application showcases the integration of a MongoDB database, an intuitive user interface, and backend processing capabilities.

## Key Features:

__Data Management:__ 
Load, filter, and interact with airport-related data, including details about runways, frequencies, and more.

__Visualization:__ 
Generate graphical representations for statistical insights, ranging from mean, median, mode statistics to correlation studies.

__Interactive User Interface:__ 
Constructed using the tkinter library, the UI is user-friendly, making data access and interaction seamless.

__Backend Processing:__ 
Integrated with the pandas library for efficient data manipulation, handling, and statistical computations.

__Database Integration:__ 
Utilizes the pymongo API to interact with a MongoDB database, demonstrating competency in database management and data retrieval.


## Technologies Used:

-  Python: The core programming language.
-  Tkinter: For building the GUI.
-  MongoDB: Database used for storing airport data.
-  PyMongo: Python API used to connect with MongoDB.
-  Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
